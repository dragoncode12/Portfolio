<h1 style="font-family:calligrapher;">Hi, welcome to my website!</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial;">My name is Therrin Smith. I am an aspiring screenplay writer. I am a junior at Notre Dame High School for Girls in San Jose. My favorite color is blue or black and I love to read and write. Writing and reading have always given me a sense of freedom and that is why I love it. I love getting lost into an entire different world. I also watch anime which is the Japanese form of cartoons but with more intricate detail and story plot. I would also love to go to Japan someday, because I love the culture and the food. Since I was ten years old I have done martial arts, I have also been going to a leadership camp for five years of my life, and I have also done girls who code. You can learn more in the What I've Done page. The purpose of this website is for my visitors to learn more about me and what my goals are. I am excited for you to learn more about me and thank you so much for visiting this website!</p>
